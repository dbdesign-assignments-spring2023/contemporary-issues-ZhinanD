# Contemporary Issues In Data

Welcome! Your writing assignment will be in this file.  See [the instructions](./instructions.md) for more details.

## Article 1
In NPR's [What Did Cambridge Analytica Do During The 2016 Election?](https://www.npr.org/2018/03/20/595338116/what-did-cambridge-analytica-do-during-the-2016-election), the author argues that Cambridge Analytica helps political elections by accessing the personal information of 50 million users of facebook, and he points out that by analyzing this big data, the psychological information of detailed American voters is obtained to help the elected change their election strategies to gain wider voter support.

This exposes one of the most important issues of today's information age: privacy and security. Internet companies are providing information technology services while gaining access to users' personal information and even privacy. They may sell this information for profit, or for political appeal, to the detriment of users' legitimate rights. I think regulators should pay more attention to such issues to prevent Internet companies from causing more serious social problems.

## Article 2
Contrary to the claims made in NPR's piece on the issue, Reason magazine's [Cambridge Analytica, the Election Interference Operation That Wasn't](https://reason.com/2020/11/03/cambridge-analytica-the-election-interference-operation-that-wasnt/) argues that the role of big data has been deliberately exaggerated by some, and that rather than such models providing substantial benefits for the presidential election, it is an outright hype and misunderstanding. He mentions that Cambridge Analytica is just a scam that even the most successful people and companies in the country believe. He argued that the focus of the case is "why people think the data is rigging the election."

However, I think this accusation is incomplete, as the author does not analyze the substantive impact of the data on the election, but only the problems that arise when professionals investigate the matter. I believe that big data should be developed in a way that protects the privacy of individuals, regardless of whether the data was obtained through proper means.
